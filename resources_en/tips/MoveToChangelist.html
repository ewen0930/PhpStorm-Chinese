    If you don't want to commit some of your changes to the repository, you can set them aside by either moving them to a separate changelist of your choice or putting them to a shelf. Select such file in the <span class="control">Local Changes</span> tab of the <span class="control">Version Control</span> tool window, and on the context menu choose either <span class="control">Move to Another Changelist</span> or <span class="control">Shelve Changes</span>.
