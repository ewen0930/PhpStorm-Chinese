    The built-in <span class="">Spellchecker</span> will help you keep your source code typo-free.
</p>

<p>
    All texts, including comments, textual strings and literals, are inspected against the pre-defined or custom dictionaries. Typos are highlighted, so that you can choose the correct word, accept the current spelling, or disable the inspection.
