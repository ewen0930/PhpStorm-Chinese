        <p>&productName; lets you jump from your check-in comment to an issue in your task tracker.
        </p>
        <p>You only need to define issue navigation patterns on the <span class="control">Version Control | Issue Navigation</span> settings/preferences page:
        </p>
        <p class="image"><img src="images/issueNavigation1.png"></p>
        <p>When you commit a changelist, and provide the commit message, make sure it matches one of your issue navigation patterns.
        Later, when you browse through the changelists in the repository, such comments turn into hyperlinks:
        </p>
        <p class="image"><img src="images/issueNavigation.png"></p>
        <p>Clicking a hyperlink brings you directly to an issue in your task tracker.
        </p>
