        If you notice that <span class="product">&productName;</span> works slowly, consider the possibility to reduce the number of folders under antivirus protection.
        </p>
	<p>
        Each antivirus check of a folder that belongs to your project consumes resources.
        You can significantly improve performance if you exclude certain folders from the antivirus protection.
